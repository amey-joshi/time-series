## Time series models
- We observed that values in a time series data are not independent of each other.
- We respect the principle of causality and assume that past values affect the
present value.
- How many past values should we consider?
  - One
  - A few
  - All
- Answer to this question decides the modelling technique.
- How do we answer the question? As usual, looking at the data may help.

## Dependence on past - SOI data
```{r}
lag1.plot(soi, 12)
```
